# myTutor

This is a very basic and simple java project without any spring framework support. I have used Junit5 framework to generate test scenarios.

I have created the models and a service class to calculate the score of a tutor.

gradlew and gradlew.bat files are pushed along with the project.

Simply clone the repo and then run below command

./gradlew clean build

It should run all the test cases which are written under scr/test module in class ScoreCalculatorTest.
